# My Curated Awesome Common Lisp

A curated list of _awesome_ Common Lisp stuff, curated for beginners.

Also don't miss the https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/ :)

You are invited to *make your own curated list*, and reference it here!

**edit: I now take much more care of the original list**


This was forked from the
[Awesome Common Lisp](https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl) and
modified following the ideas:
- useful things (for beginners) first: dev environment comes first, crypto last.
- prefer libraries that are superseeded by new and better ones: Drakma
  is replaced by Dexador
- prefer documented libraries
- justifications come from my experience, and I am not experienced on all topics.
- remove some stuff. For a real look at the CL ecosystem, refer to the Awesome List, to Quickdocs or to Cliki.

All libraries listed here are available from [Quicklisp][16].

And see below, learning and tutorials.



Text Editor Resources
=====================

[Cookbook: getting started](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/getting-started.html)

This contains plugins and other goodies for various text editors.

[Cookbook: editor resources](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/editor-support.html)

## Emacs ##

* [Portacle][201] - A portable and multiplatform Common Lisp environment: SBCL, Quicklisp, Emacs, Slime, Git.
* [SLIME][29] - Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs; a full-blown environment for Common Lisp inside of Emacs. Public domain.

## Vim ##

* [SLIMV][187] - Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Vim; a full-blown environment for Common Lisp inside of Vim. No license specified.

## Atom ##

* [SLIMA](https://github.com/neil-lindquist/SLIMA/) allows you to
  interactively develop Common Lisp code, helping turn Atom into a
  full-featured Lisp IDE. [MIT][200].

## VSCode

* [alive](https://github.com/nobody-famous/alive) -  Common Lisp Extension for VSCode. Public domain.
  * see the Cookbook: [using VSCode with Alive](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/vscode-alive.html)


## Notebooks ##

* [cl-jupyter](https://github.com/fredokun/cl-jupyter) - A Common Lisp kernel for Jupyter notebooks [custom licence](https://github.com/fredokun/cl-jupyter/blob/master/LICENSE).

## REPLs ##

* [cl-repl](https://github.com/koji-kojiro/cl-repl) - an ipython-like REPL. With completion, shell commands, magic commands, debugger, etc. [MIT][200]. With [colorthemes](https://github.com/koji-kojiro/lem-pygments-colorthemes).
* [sbcli](https://github.com/hellerve/sbcli) - a simple readline REPL that doesn't get in your way. It doesn't have a debugger, it just prints the error. With optional syntax highlighting and useful shortcuts.

Implementations
===============

* [SBCL][12] - A fork of CMUCL; compiles to machine code. [Standard compliance][13]. Public domain, with some parts under [Expat][14] and [3-clause BSD][15].
  - *Just use it if you don't know*
  - *Install it from your package manager: `apt install sbcl`*
  - *It does thorough type checking*
  - *Google contributes to SBCL!*
* [Clozure Common Lisp](https://ccl.clozure.com/docs/ccl.html), for its fast compilation time, and to use on 32bits Raspberry Pi.

But there are more, see other ressources.

Build Systems
=============

* [ASDF][131] - it's the de-facto build system shipped with the implementations.

Library Manager
===============

* [Quicklisp][16] - *The* library manager.
  - *You just must use it, then learn other tools that complement it.
* [Ultralisp](https://ultralisp.org/) - A quicklisp distribution that builds every five minutes (instead of one month for Quicklisp), and requires 3 clicks to add your project to it (instead of opening an issue and waiting for Quicklisp).
* [Roswell](https://github.com/roswell/roswell) - A Lisp implementation installer, script launcher and more.
  - *it's useful, but not necessary to getting started.*
* [qlot][135] - A project-local library installer, similar to Bundler or Carton.

Tools
=====

These are applications or bits of code that make development in Common Lisp easier without being Common Lisp libraries themselves.

* [cl-cookieproject](https://github.com/vindarel/cl-cookieproject) - my project skeleton, more complete than the others. *New in 2021 :)*
* [quicksearch][140] - Look up online libraries from the REPL. *This one helped me sometimes*.

Web
===

HTTP clients
------------
* [Dexador][199] - An HTTP client: `(dex:get "http://url.com")`.

Web frameworks
--------------

There are more on the awesome-cl list, and in the wild. Those are my choices.

* Hunchentoot documentation on a "read the docs" style: https://common-lisp-libraries.readthedocs.io/hunchentoot/
* üëç [easy-routes](https://github.com/mmontone/easy-routes) - a routes handling system on top of Hunchentoot. It supports dispatch based on HTTP method, arguments extraction from the url path, decorators, url generation from route name, etc.
  - *I like it a lot, that's what I use to define routes.*
* [Caveman][92] - A powerful web framework.
  - *Written by E. Fukamachi, and with stars.*
* [Wookie](https://github.com/orthecreedence/wookie) - Asynchronous HTTP server. [Expat][14].
* [Snooze](https://github.com/joaotavora/snooze) - A RESTful web framework, built on Clack, where routes are just functions and HTTP conditions are just Lisp conditions. [LLGPL][8].
  - *it seems great*
* [radiance](https://github.com/Shirakumo/radiance) - An extensible framework library and multi-application CMS.
* [cl-rest-server](https://github.com/mmontone/cl-rest-server) - a library for writing REST web APIs. Features validation with schemas, annotations for logging, caching, permissions or authentication, documentation via Swagger, etc. [MIT][200].
* [Weblocks](https://github.com/40ants/weblocks) - A widgets-based framework with a built-in ajax update mechanism that "solves the JavaScript problem". [LLGPL][8].
  - *see its getting started tutorial, and come follow in the Gitter chat. I don't find Weblocks readme, though I built a toy web app with success. Things are happening there.*

There are more projects, more or less discontinued but interesting. See the other ressources.

*my 2 cents*: I find Clack-based frameworks (like Caveman) tedious to use. Be sure to test others (Wookie, Snooze,‚Ä¶). Don't juge projects uniquely by their numbers of Github stars.

  - *Quite new, didn't try.*
* [spinneret][191] - Common Lisp HTML5 generator.
* [cl-markup][101] - Modern markup generation library. [LLGPL][8].

There are at least two for JSX-like mix of HTML inside Lisp. Crazy.

Utilities for Implementation and OS Portability. It abstracts os
utilities (getevn, chdir, etc), pathnames, the filesystem, images,

Learning and Tutorials
=====================

üì¢ Everyone, I have an announce! I have been learning CL the hard way:
I read a lot, I wrote a lot of tutorials on the Cookbook and on my
blog, I had to ask a lot of questions, I built libraries and softwares
and I stumbled across a lot of issues. Often, my problems were not due
to the language itself, but rather in interfacing with the outside world.

So, **I built a Common Lisp course in videos** with the goal for it to be
**the most efficient way to learn Common Lisp today**. It is on Udemy:

- üìπ [Common Lisp programming: from novice to effective developer](https://www.udemy.com/course/common-lisp-programming/?referralCode=2F3D698BBC4326F94358) ‚≠ê

You can find the table of contents details, notes and exercises on
[its Github](https://github.com/vindarel/common-lisp-course-in-videos/). It
takes so much time that it is not available for free. Check my Twitter or [my blog](https://lisp-journey.gitlab.io/) for discounts (at the beginning of the month, often). Thanks for your support, it helps.

See also other videos I post on Youtube sometimes:

- [How to create a full-featured Common Lisp project from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFc513MJjos&feature=youtu.be)
- [Web requests in Common Lisp: how to fetch the Github API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAtwcBh1QLg)
- etc
